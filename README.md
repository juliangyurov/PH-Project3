**Challenge**

1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The `activityItems` parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. Note: Facebook wonâ€™t let you share text, but most other share options will.

2. Go back to Project1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.

3. Go back to Project2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.
